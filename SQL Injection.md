<p>Today on the way home from work I was listening to the 33rd episode of the podcast Darknet Diaries, by Jack Rysider and this episode was about this man named Tom and how he discovered SQL injection vulnerabilities on multiple websites he had visited.</p>

<p>Tom, having experience in the IT field, had attempted to log into a website using a single quote. The website would go blank and display the error code "You Have an Error in Your SQL Syntax."2 The episode continues down the path of discussing more about SQL injection and sanitising user input. This got me thinking and wanting to learn more. Currently, I'm in the process of completing Google's cybersecurity certificate on Coursera, and this topic of SQL injection has been covered but I wanted to do my own investigations to find out more about how SQL injections are done and what exactly sanitisation of user input is. So I did some digging.</p>

<p>According to codeacademy.com: “Through cleverly constructed text inputs that modify the backend SQL query, threat actors can force the application to output private data or respond in ways that provide intel.” Even just reading the first few paragraphs of this webpage I’m amazed at the different methods, or rather, SQL injection techniques.</p>

<p>After reading the description of union-based injections and trying to understand the examples of code that they used to explain the definition of UNION SELECT, I was still left a little unsure that I understood what union-based injections are. My thoughts were “wait, this sounds a lot like an inner join query.” So, I decided to do a quick google search to find further explanations to help me understand what this means. What I did find was a really helpful diagram that gave a very simple yet easier way for me to understand what the difference was between UNION and JOIN queries, shown below.</p>

<p>Then after finding this diagram I began to read on from the ‘Scaler’ webpage article that this image originally came from. After reading through this information I have a far better understanding of the difference between UNION and JOIN. UNION is used when we want to display the results of two SELECT queries. This can be used to obtain usernames and passwords from two different tables. Consider an ecommerce website that stores passwords as simple strings that aren’t hashed, you could gather passwords and match them to usernames by using UNION to combine two SELECT statements. Note that with UNION the result does not contain any duplicated records. With JOIN you are extracting the data from more than one table and those records are combined into a new column, and that is the result. Put simply, UNION combines records of two SELECT statements’ results, and JOIN uses SELECT to combine as a result.</p>

<p>Reading the codeacademy article about error-based injections. This still doesn’t really explain in a way that I can understand, so I did another google search to find a better understanding of error-based injections. Throwback to earlier in this blog post when I mentioned that Tom used a single quote in the website's login form and got that error regarding syntax. I found a website that I recognised, owasp.org, that continues to explain more about SQL injections with examples. Yes! I recognise this website as one of the resources from my time completing the Google certificate. So far this is one of the most creative ways to exploit databases online. From my understanding, if a threat actor is unable to get the information that they want using techniques like UNION they can use errors to display and extract the data that they want. The way in which this exploit is used is not in the log-in form but in the URL where adding a command after a standard query search will display the parameter added using two pipes. Here is an example of this in action:</p>
